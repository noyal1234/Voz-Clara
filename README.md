# Voz-Clara: AI-Powered Visual Assistance for the Visually Impaired

**Voz-Clara** is an edge-deployed Visual Question Answering (VQA) system built to assist **visually impaired individuals** in navigating and understanding their environment through spoken interactions. The project leverages the power of **generative vision-language models** and is optimized for real-time use on **Jetson Orin Nano**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Voz-Clara enables users to **ask questions about their surroundings**, captured via camera, and **receive spoken answers**. Designed to be **fast, accessible, and edge-deployable**, it brings VQA technology to real-world assistive use cases.

## üß† Core Model

- **Model**: [`PaLI-Gemma 2`](https://ai.googleblog.com/2024/03/pali-gemma-multimodal-models.html)  
- **Dataset**: [VizWiz VQA Dataset](https://vizwiz.org/)  
- **Optimizations**:
  - Fine-tuned for real-world image-question answering
  - Quantized for deployment on **Jetson Orin Nano**
  - Converted to ONNX for edge inference(have not included in the github repo)

## üî¨ Model Comparisons

To evaluate the performance of different architectures, inference was also conducted using:

- **UForm Gen2 + Qwen 500M**
- **Gemini API (via cloud interface)**

Each model was tested on real-world VQA tasks from VizWiz for qualitative and latency-based comparison.
